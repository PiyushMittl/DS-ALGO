[root] is the root node if a tree
[teampHead] is temporary root node
[node] is the node to be inserted

Step1: if [tempHead] is null then node is your root node
		assign node reference to tempHead and return tempHead
Step2: while condition if [tempHead] is not null
Step3: check if [node.data] > [tempHead.data]
       if yes then check if [tempHead.left] is null
       		if yes then [tempHead.left] = [node]
       		and return [tempHead]
       		else [tempHead] = [tempHead.left]
       if no then check if [tempHead.right] is null
       		if yes then [tempHead.right] = [node]
       		and return [tempHead]
       		else [tempHead] = [tempHead.rigt]
Step5: repeat step3 until [teampHead] is not null
